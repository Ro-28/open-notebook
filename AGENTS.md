# Open Notebook — Agent Rules

Open Notebook is an open-source, privacy-focused alternative to Google's Notebook LM: an AI-powered research assistant with multi-provider AI support, fully self-hostable.

This file holds the project-wide rules every coding session needs. Component rules: [open_notebook/AGENTS.md](open_notebook/AGENTS.md) (backend — also covers `api/`, `commands/`, `prompts/`) and [frontend/AGENTS.md](frontend/AGENTS.md). Knowledge lives in the docs (see [Where to look](#where-to-look)) — read it on demand instead of guessing.

## Stack, ports, startup order

Three tiers: Next.js frontend (3001 for this fork's local development) → FastAPI (5055) → SurrealDB (8000). Upstream/Docker port defaults remain unchanged.

Start in this order — each tier depends on the one below:

1. `make database` — SurrealDB (API fails without it)
2. `make api` — FastAPI; **schema migrations run automatically on startup** (check logs)
3. `make worker-start` — surreal-commands worker. **Required**: podcasts, embeddings and source processing are async jobs that silently queue forever without it
4. `PORT=3001 make frontend` — UI (depends on the API for all data)

Or all at once: `PORT=3001 make start-all` (its legacy banner still says 3000; open http://localhost:3001). For the packaged macOS app, use `scripts/app/open-notebook.sh start|status|stop`; it defaults to UI port 3001 and stops only verified service owners.

## Commands

- Tests: `uv run pytest tests/`
- Python lint/typecheck: `ruff check . --fix` · `uv run python -m mypy .`
- Frontend (inside `frontend/`): `npm run lint` · `npm run test` · `npm run build`
- Docker release: `make docker-release` (see `.github/RELEASE_PROCESS.md`)

## Hard rules

- **Async-first**: every DB query, graph invocation and AI call is `await`-ed. No sync DB access.
- **Never commit secrets.** Credentials are encrypted at rest and require `OPEN_NOTEBOOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY` to be set.
- CORS is wide-open and auth is a simple password middleware — **dev defaults, not production hardening**. Don't build features that assume otherwise.
- Product direction questions (does this feature fit?) → [VISION.md](VISION.md). Past decisions ("why is it like this?") → [docs/7-DEVELOPMENT/decisions/](docs/7-DEVELOPMENT/decisions/). Structural decisions made while coding should produce a new decision record there.
